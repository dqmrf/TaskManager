Task Management Application

Goal - build task management system using Ruby on Rails technology.

Acceptance Criteria:

1 Authentication system. User should be able to:
  - sign up
  - sign in
  - sign out
  1.1 User has next attributes:
    - first name
    - last name
    - email
  1.2 User receives email with activation link after sign up
2 Home page. User should be able to:
  - view all tasks (the list of all tasks which belong to user, display only title)
  - by mousing hover a particular task the "edit" and "delete" links should appear next to the title
  - create new task
  - edit existing task
  - delete existing task
  - mark task as completed
  - make it active again if task is completed
  2.1 User can manage only his own tasks
  2.2 Task has next attributes:
       - title
       - description
       - priority
       - due date
  2.3 Basicaly there should be two lists, one is active tasks, another one is completed. By marking task as completed a task moves to appropriate list. 
3 Task details page
   - every title of the task on the home page is a link, by clicking the link user is taken to this page
   - on this page user can see all the attributes of the task
4 Edit task page
   - by clicking "edit" link on the Home page user is taken to this page
   - this page displays a form with task's data
   - user should be able to edit any attribute
   - validation rules should be applied
      -- title can't be blank
      -- priority should be a number
      -- due date should be a future date
      -- nice to have if there is client side validation as well
   4.1 use datepicker for date input
5 User should be able to make a batch delete on the Home page
  - checkboxes next to each task, user checks some tasks and clicks button 'batch delete' which deletes selected tasks
  - there should be two links/buttons: 'check all' and 'uncheck all'
6 User should be able to sort the list on the Home page by title
7 User twitter bootstrap for nice UI
8 Few tests with Rspec (e.g. add a method `full name` to user model and add tests for it, add tests for validation rules)
9 Try to use Ajax wherever it's possible (e.g. delete task on the home page), minimum page reloads
10 use github to host the code, use heroku to deploy the app
